Modular Optical Wireless Elements

This project was created at The University of Oklahoma (OU) as part of my phd research on mobile free-space optics (FSO) and optical wireless communications. I'll try to post most, if not all, materials related to this project online as open-source content, including hardware schematics, MCU firmware, and software development tools.

The Modular Optical Wireless Elements (MOWE) system consists of smart, electrically interconnected modules that can be combined together to build flat and curved optical wireless array. This novel design offers lightweight, inexpensive, and wide field-of-view terminals for various applications ranging from user tracking and noise measurements to broadband connectivity and MIMO FSO.
