We'll try to post most, if not all, materials related to this project online as open-source content, including hardware schematics, MCU firmware, and software development tools.\r\n\r\n### MOWE Concept\r\nThe *Modular Optical Wireless Elements* (MOWE) system consists of smart, electrically interconnected modules that can be combined together to build flat and curved optical wireless array. This novel design offers lightweight, inexpensive, and wide field-of-view terminals for various applications ranging from user tracking and noise measurements to broadband connectivity and MIMO FSO.\r\n\r\nA single *array* is composed of multiple *modules* soldered side-by-side to form a single, continuous flat or curved surface that could be structurally supported by a 3D-printed plastic *frame*. The array, frame and a *central controller* with wired or wireless interface constitute a complete optical *terminal*. The MOWE concept is depicted below.\r\n\r\n![MOWE Concept](images/MOWE_Concept.PNG)\r\n*From left to right*: Individual modules are assembled into array. Arrays are fitted with structural 3D-printed frames. Arrays and frames make a complete terminal that can be used in various applications, e.g., on board a multirotor UAV.\r\n\r\n### Flexible & User-friendly\r\nEach modules is a single optical point (either transmitter, receiver or transceiver). All modules run a custom-designed operating system called **Array Operating System** (AOS) that handles user interactions, inter-array communications, and array housekeeping functionality (e.g., cross-array routing, module labeling and identification, broadcast commands, firmware upgrades, and others).\r\n\r\nA *regular user* can interact with the array via the **command line parser** (CLP) utility within the AOS. The CLP can be accessed via any port in any module and features various intuitive control commands in a plain English language. Some commands are used to setup the array, ping the modules, rename them, and group them; other commands read samples from receiver modules and stream data in/out the modules at various speeds. More advanced commands are also available to update modules firmware on the fly, setup inter-array DMA streams, link two modules, and send a predefined signal out a transmitter module among others. These intuitive commands make the MOWE system easily accessible by any student/researcher regardless if he or she has hardware or Embedded Systems development expertise. \r\n\r\n*Experienced users*, on the other hand, can further leverage the system by writing their own firmware in C language or modifying the AOS and other available firmware implementations to suit their exact application.\r\n\r\n### Possible Applications\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\n\r\n### Research Papers\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgment\r\nI'm grateful to everyone contributed to this project especially: \r\n\r\n    * Fahed Babelli and Walid Balid from the University of Oklahoma for their help in testing MOWE hardware.\r\n\r\n    * Brady Deetz and the [Tandy Supercomputing Center](http://www.tandysupercomputing.org/) (TSC) in Tulsa, Oklahoma for the development and support of the MOWE-Tandy Simulator. \r\n\r\n    * Nishaal Parmer from the University of Oklahoma for analysing and developing inter-array routing and broadcasting algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to contribute?\r\nThis project is still in development and we'll be excited to get your feedback and participation!
