{"name":"MOWE","tagline":"Modular Optical Wireless Elements","body":"### Modular Optical Wireless Elements\r\n\r\nThis project has been created at by **Asaad Kaadan** at the **University of Oklahoma** (OU) as part of his phd research on mobile free-space optics (FSO) and optical wireless communications under supervision of **Dr. Hazem Refai** (University of Oklahoma) and **Dr. Peter LoPresti** (University of Tulsa). We'll try to post most, if not all, materials related to this project online as open-source content, including hardware schematics, MCU firmware, and software development tools.\r\n\r\nThe *Modular Optical Wireless Elements* (MOWE) system consists of smart, electrically interconnected modules that can be combined together to build flat and curved optical wireless array. This novel design offers lightweight, inexpensive, and wide field-of-view terminals for various applications ranging from user tracking and noise measurements to broadband connectivity and MIMO FSO.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
