We'll try to post most, if not all, materials related to this project online as open-source content, including hardware schematics, MCU firmware, and software development tools.\r\n\r\n### MOWE Concept\r\nThe *Modular Optical Wireless Elements* (MOWE) system consists of smart, electrically interconnected modules that can be combined together to build flat and curved optical wireless array. This novel design offers lightweight, inexpensive, and wide field-of-view terminals for various applications ranging from user tracking and noise measurements to broadband connectivity and MIMO FSO.\r\nA single *array* is composed of multiple *modules* soldered side-by-side to form a single, continuous flat or curved surface that could be structurally supported by a 3D-printed plastic *frame*. The array, frame and a *central controller* with wired or wireless interface constitute a complete optical *terminal*. The MOWE concept is depicted below.\r\n![MOWE Concept](images/MOWE_Concept.PNG)\r\n\r\n### Possible Applications\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\n\r\n### Research Papers\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgment\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
