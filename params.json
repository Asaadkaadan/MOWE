{"name":"MOWE","tagline":"Modular Optical Wireless Elements","body":"### Modular Optical Wireless Elements\r\n\r\nThis project has been created at by **[Asaad Kaadan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asaadkaadan)** at the **[University of Oklahoma](http://www.ou.edu/)** (OU) as part of his phd research on mobile free-space optics (FSO) and optical wireless communications under supervision of **[Dr. Hazem Refai](http://www.ou.edu/coe/ece/faculty_directory/dr_refai.html)** (University of Oklahoma) and **[Dr. Peter LoPresti](https://faculty.utulsa.edu/college-of-engineering-natural-sciences/electrical-and-computer-engineering/peter-lopresti)** (University of Tulsa). We'll try to post most, if not all, materials related to this project online as open-source content, including hardware schematics, MCU firmware, and software development tools.\r\n\r\n### MOWE Concept\r\nThe *Modular Optical Wireless Elements* (MOWE) system consists of smart, electrically interconnected modules that can be combined together to build flat and curved optical wireless array. This novel design offers lightweight, inexpensive, and wide field-of-view terminals for various applications ranging from user tracking and noise measurements to broadband connectivity and MIMO FSO.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
