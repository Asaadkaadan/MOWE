<p>This project has been created at by <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asaadkaadan">Asaad Kaadan</a></strong> at the <strong><a href="http://www.ou.edu/">University of Oklahoma</a></strong> (OU) as part of his phd research on mobile free-space optics (FSO) and optical wireless communications under supervision of <strong><a href="http://www.ou.edu/coe/ece/faculty_directory/dr_refai.html">Dr. Hazem Refai</a></strong> (University of Oklahoma) and <strong><a href="https://faculty.utulsa.edu/college-of-engineering-natural-sciences/electrical-and-computer-engineering/peter-lopresti">Dr. Peter LoPresti</a></strong> (University of Tulsa). We'll try to post most, if not all, materials related to this project online as open-source content, including hardware schematics, MCU firmware, and software development tools.</p>

<p>The <em>Modular Optical Wireless Elements</em> (MOWE) system consists of smart, electrically interconnected modules that can be combined together to build flat and curved optical wireless array. This novel design offers lightweight, inexpensive, and wide field-of-view terminals for various applications ranging from user tracking and noise measurements to broadband connectivity and MIMO FSO.</p>

<p>A single <em>array</em> is composed of multiple <em>modules</em> soldered side-by-side to form a single, continuous flat or curved surface that could be structurally supported by a 3D-printed plastic <em>frame</em>. The array, frame and a <em>central controller</em> with wired or wireless interface constitute a complete optical <em>terminal</em>. The MOWE concept is depicted below.</p>

<em>From left to right</em>: Individual modules are assembled into array. Arrays are fitted with structural 3D-printed frames. Arrays and frames make a complete terminal that can be used in various applications, e.g., on board a multirotor UAV.</p>

<p>Each modules is a single optical point (either transmitter, receiver or transceiver). All modules run a custom-designed operating system called <strong>Array Operating System</strong> (AOS) that handles user interactions, inter-array communications, and array housekeeping functionality (e.g., cross-array routing, module labeling and identification, broadcast commands, firmware upgrades, and others).</p>

<p>A <em>regular user</em> can interact with the array via the <strong>command line parser</strong> (CLP) utility within the AOS. The CLP can be accessed via any port in any module and features various intuitive control commands in a plain English language. Some commands are used to setup the array, ping the modules, rename them, and group them; other commands read samples from receiver modules and stream data in/out the modules at various speeds. More advanced commands are also available to update modules firmware on the fly, setup inter-array DMA streams, link two modules, and send a predefined signal out a transmitter module among others. These intuitive commands make the MOWE system easily accessible by any student/researcher regardless if he or she has hardware or Embedded Systems development expertise. </p>

<p><em>Experienced users</em>, on the other hand, can further leverage the system by writing their own firmware in C language or modifying the AOS and other available firmware implementations to suit their exact application.</p>
